                <p>Ian's Pizza is a Seattle classic. Located right on Broadway in Capitol Hill, it's a hop skip 
                    and a jump from some of the best parts of Seattle. If you're in the mood for a slice out with your friends, 
                    Ian's is a great spot for a stop. I just so happened to be out by Ian's picking up some art supplies 
                    at Blick next door, and decided to stop in for a few slices with my girlfriend Devon to kick off 
                    SLP. I asked the cashier to run me through the pies they had. I wasn't sure what to get as she 
                    ran through a trove of different pies: a philly cheesesteak, buffalo chicken, vegan burger, 
                    tomatoe pesto, mac and cheese. We ended up taking 4 differently slices based off some of her 
                    recommendations and some of our favorites.</p>

                        </p><&nbsp>Mac and cheese: Who doesn't love mac and cheese? Yeah it might not be what you always want on your pizza, but if someone offered you a bite you know you'd try it with no hesitation. It's pretty plain overall and benefits from some accesories like honey and chili flake.</p>
